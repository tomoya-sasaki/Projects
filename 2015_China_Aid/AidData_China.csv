"39073","China","Chinese company to buy wind power operator in Brazil","2015","false","STAFF_NOTE: Company name and transaction amount unclear. No specifics whatsoever. China is a “major driver” of environmental degradation in Latin America 15 Apr by Robert Soutar 0 Comments Share China’s increased trade and investment in Latin America over the past decade has resulted in powerful social and environmental impacts such as job losses and pollution, although the growing relationship has also brought some benefits, says new research published today. The high concentration of Chinese activity in Latin America’s agriculture and extractive sectors has placed a heavy strain on water supplies, increased deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) and is aggravating local concerns about resource use and job creation, the study coordinated by Boston University’s Global Economic Governance Initiative (GEGI) concludes. But the paper, entitled China in Latin America: Lessons for South-South Cooperation and Sustainable Development also highlights the potential for cooperation on renewable energy projects. And while China’s mining, hydropower and railway companies are stamping an indelible footprint on Latin American landscapes, the paper notes that Chinese companies do not necessarily perform any worse than other international firms operating in the region, despite their relative inexperience and lower levels of regulation at home. Latin America: exporting water, importing carbon Since China launched its “go global” strategy just over a decade ago, Chinese investors have funnelled upwards of US$ 120 billion into Latin America, more than any other country or international lending institution. Loans to Latin America have increased more than 20% year on year since 2005. These investments, mostly by China’s state-led policy banks, enable the construction of dams, roads, ports and mines that act as a “major driver” of the degradation of sensitive Latin American environments, the paper says. Investments have stimulated the growth of a trade relationship that yields some of the most striking findings. Around 100 billion cubic metres of water, almost the same volume as Lake Nicaragua, the largest freshwater reserve in Central America, was embedded in Latin American exports to China in 2012 alone, the paper revealed. High commodity prices in the 2000s driven by China’s rapid growth led many Latin American governments to prioritise the export of primary products. Lucrative returns from exports like oil, gas, copper and soya alleviated balance of payments problems, and even allowed some countries to accrue surpluses. But at the same time this set the region on an environmentally hazardous course. Latin America has doubled its agricultural exports to China in the last decade. Food security is a top priority in China as it seeks to satisfy the alimentary needs of its increasingly carnivorous population and Brazilian and Argentine soya, crushed to make soymeal, are widely used sources of food for Chinese livestock. Brazil, which has been plagued by drought in recent months, exports around 82% of its soybeans to China, some 32 million metric tons each year. But the cultivation of cash crops has put a strain on scarce water resources and farmers are using ever more intensive methods such as genetically modified (GM) crops and stronger chemical pesticides. Despite some public resistance, China lifted restrictions on GM food imports in 2013 and GM soya purchases from Brazil have increased as a result. Food safety regulations are slackening on the demand-side and the increasing share of GDP generated by Latin America’s agriculture and hydrocarbons sectors is further empowering its big businesses and ‘dirty’ ministries and encourages them to relax social and environmental protections in search of higher returns. Between 2009 and 2013, extractive industries accounted for 56% of all Latin American exports to China compared to just 25% between 1999 and 2003. As a whole, exports of minerals and metals from Latin America have increased from 22% to 33% over the respective periods, the research states. Source: Calculations of authors of China in Latin America: Lessons for South-South Cooperation and Sustainable Development and UN Comtrade data Source: China in Latin America: Lessons for South-South Cooperation and Sustainable Development, figures based on author’s calculations and UN Comtrade data But while primary industries are highly carbon- and water-intensive, the amount of GHGs emitted by Latin America in getting products to the Chinese market only amounts to around half of the emissions that result in products that China sends to Latin America, the report finds. At the same time, importing Chinese manufactured products has had a detrimental impact on Latin American manufacturing. Not only has the share of higher value-added activities fallen over the last 10 years, the prospect of social conflicts has risen as new jobs created in resource-based industries have been far fewer than those lost in manufacturing. Social impacts Employment opportunities are a major concern for Latin Americans worried that many of the new jobs created in key industries will be reserved for Chinese workers. In Ecuador, foreign companies are unable to employ foreign workers as long as local workers are available, But in Brazil, the country’s federal parliament recently tabled controversial labour reforms that would make it easier for companies operating in the country to subcontract or outsource to foreign workers. In Argentina, President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner had to allay fears that the majority of jobs constructing two new nuclear power plants will not be through China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), the contractor supplying the reactors and other nuclear technology. However, not all social impacts have been negative. China’s Chinalco relocated an entire village of 5,000 inhabitants from the highland town of Morococha in Peru, which was suffering the consequences of poorly regulated copper mining. So as not to exacerbate toxic waste and pollution, Chinalco constructed a shiny new town with proper sanitation, a school and a hospital. Low-carbon potential The report points out that China, through its production of cheap photovoltaic solar panels, has contributed to an increased share of renewables in Chile’s energy mix. A Brazilian wind power operator could soon be owned by a Chinese counterpart, which could enable more low carbon capacity to be added to the country’s national grid at a time that hydroelectric output has been curtailed by droughts. The paper says that low-carbon partnerships can be also developed in other areas, such as creating sustainable cities. Urban expansion accounts for a substantial proportion of Latin American countries’ GHG emissions, although China’s experience suggests that building-in low-carbon infrastructure is fraught with obstacles. Research on China and Latin America gives rise to some worrying statistics, and learning lessons will be crucial for the partnership to pursue a more sustainable development path.","230","Energy Generation and Supply","","Pipeline: Vague","13","Vague TBD","Brazil","http://dialogochino.net/china-is-a-major-driver-of-environmental-degradation-in-latin-america/?utm_source=GEGI+Round+Up+31+Eblast&utm_campaign=GEGI+Round+Up+31+Eblast&utm_medium=archive, Media Report, including Wikileaks","1","","","","","","","Suspicious","0","Unset","1","Commercial","2","Active","1","","","","","","","","","","","","1","Brazil","140","431","Brazil","BRA","BR","76","223","false","false","false","false","","","","","","2015-07-29 11:04:59 -0400","","",0

"39155","China","China Export import bank and Industrial and Commercial bank loan 5 billion usd to Petrobras","2015","false"," Summary: In 2015, in response to Petrobras' corruption scandal, China offered a US$ 10bn line of credit, consisting of 5bn from CDB and 5bn from the EXIM Bank and ICBC combined. These were the main details throughout media reports. Specific financial details were not found. What do you do when you’re burdened with the oil industry’s biggest debt, credit is drying up and some of your main suppliers are under the gun? Call China. Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff’s strategy of turning to fellow BRIC member China to finance the country’s prized state-controlled oil company is paying off as she and Premier Li Keqiang unveiled $10 billion in Chinese credit. The fresh funding comes as Rio de Janeiro-based Petrobras seeks to leave behind the biggest crisis of its almost 62-year history. Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as it’s known formally, has been at the center of a corruption scandal that sent shudders through the country’s business and political elites and all but closed access to bond markets, while ill-conceived projects prompted $15 billion in writedowns. “This shows Petrobras is looking for any alternative to avoid cash-flow problems this year,” Bruno Caloni, an analyst at Coinvalores brokerage, said by telephone from Sao Paulo. “Petrobras is building a trust relationship with China.” The $10 billion announcement includes $5 billion in loans from China Development Bank, of which $3.5 billion was disbursed last month, and two initial agreements worth a combined $5 billion with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the country’s Export-Import Bank. The Chinese financing package surpasses the $8.5 billion obtained by Petrobras from bond investors in March 2014, the last time the producer -- one of the biggest emerging-market bond issuers --- sold debt in international markets. “The main objective is to guarantee the oil supply, even if it has a political bias,” said Reinado Ma, a partner at TozziniFreire Advogados.

"38812","China","China plans to offer 6,000 scholarships for Latin American students to study in China","2015","false"," By Zhao Hui, Zheng Jiandong, Mao Pengfei BEIJING/MEXICO CITY, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Keqiang's recent fruitful four-nation tour of Latin America has raised bilateral cooperation to a higher level. Li's busy schedule featured two cultural events, in Colombia and Peru respectively, underlining the importance the Chinese government attaches to bilateral cultural exchanges. Wu Changsheng, director of the Latin American Studies Center at the China Foundation for International Studies, said that cultural exchanges between the two sides have been lacking, but goodwill exists among governments and peoples to increase mutual understanding. COLOMBIA: LITERATURE AS A BRIDGE During his day-long visit to Colombia, Li and Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos presided over a symposium on China-Latin America cultural exchange to promote the interchange of contemporary literature between the two distinct cultures. China's delegation to the conference featured Mo Yan, a winner of the Nobel Prize in literature, and Mai Jia, a Chinese writer who has sold the most books translated into Spanish. Representing Colombia were poet Horacio Benavides and author Santiago Gamboa. Li has proposed that China and Latin America strengthen not just material but also spiritual cooperation, and rely on the power of literature to achieve heart-to-heart communication. He called on writers and artists from both countries to increase interchange and dialogue to learn more about each other and help deepen cooperation for mutual benefit. Mo, for example, paid tribute to famed Colombian-born author Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who had a profound impact on contemporary Chinese literature during the 1980s. Benavides, meanwhile, recited poems from an anthology of Chinese poets, such as Li Bai, one of the most renowned poets of the Tang Dynasty (A.D. 618 - A.D. 907). Through their unique stories and styles such as magic realism in the case of Colombia and other Latin American countries, the literary works of one civilization can serve to spread knowledge and understanding among other distant and distinct cultures, and to highlight cultural similarities. In recent years, a host of contemporary works of Chinese literature have been translated into Spanish and are available at bookstores throughout Latin America, making Chinese works much more accessible to Latin American audiences. Colombia has a great appreciation for China's time-honored civilization, which dates back to some 5,000 years ago, said Santos, adding he is confident that the two peoples will increasingly consolidate their mutual understanding through cultural exchanges. PERU: ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS, MODERN CONNECTIONS In Peru, the third leg of his tour, Li inaugurated an exhibit titled 'Encounter between Chinese and Latin American Civilizations,' which featured ancient pre-Incan and Incan artifacts alongside images of early Chinese civilization. Such exhibits can serve to foster an interest in learning about each others' civilizations, Li said. Carmen Carrasco, director of Lima's National Museum of Archaeology, Anthropology and History (MAAH), noted Li's great interest in artifacts about the historical evolution of Peru's indigenous civilizations, including a stone relic from the pre-Incan Chavin and woven textiles from the Paracas. 'Chinese Premier Li Keqiang's presence in this emblematic venue is very important,' Carrasco told Xinhua, as it shows the Asian country is interested 'not just in economic matters, but in deepening cultural knowledge, which is essential to bilateral exchanges.' Carrasco noted the affinities between the early Chinese and pre-Incan civilizations, saying 'there is a symbiosis between the two sides' due to 'similarities found in stone relics, the rational use of water, agriculture, and other areas.' Meanwhile, across the globe an exhibit of contemporary Latin American art was under way in Beijing, bringing scenes of the region's landscape, historical traditions and multiculturalism to Chinese viewers. Organizers of the exhibit, held under the banner 'Sharing Beauty,' hoped that the exhibit will serve to strengthen cultural exchanges between China and Latin America, and promote goodwill between the two peoples. CHINA-LATIN AMERICA: MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING In the past decade, trade between China and Latin America boomed, with the two-way volume growing by 20 times. Still, the lack of mutual knowledge about each others' history, culture and society is becoming increasingly incompatible with the rapid growth in trade and investment, and could present a disincentive to expanding cooperation. In 2014, China proposed rebuilding bilateral ties on five main pillars, including raising mutual awareness about each others' civilizations, in addition to political and economic cooperation. As part of that strategy, China plans to offer 6,000 scholarships for Latin American students to study in China for the 2015-2019 period, and invite another 6,000 Latin Americans to take training courses, and an additional 400 candidates to take part in postgraduate courses. China also plans to launch this year a program called 'Bridge towards the Future,' which is designed to train some 1,000 young Chinese and Latin American students. Meanwhile, the year of 2016 will be designated as the Year of China-Latin America Cultural Exchange. Wu Baiyi, director of the Latin America Institute at China's Academy of Social Sciences, pointed out that restructuring bilateral ties and calling for stronger cultural connections show the Chinese government's intention to overcome cultural obstacles as it continues to expand practical bilateral cooperation to new areas. Cultural exchange is an intrinsic part of the process of modernizing ties between China and Latin America, and of deepening mutual understanding to strengthen the foundation for sustainable and fruitful cooperation, said Wu. Enrique Garcia, president of the Development Bank of Latin America, known by its Spanish acronym CAF, echoed Wu on the importance of cultural exchanges. 'To have a fruitful relationship in the long term, you have to look at the whole picture. The Chinese should know the Latin Americans and the Latin Americans should know the Chinese, and they should better understand their cultural differences,' Garcia said. During a speech to the cultural symposium held in Colombia, the Chinese premier expressed his hope that peoples of both sides will increase cultural exchanges and heart-to-heart communication, so that the trees of cooperation can bear more fruit in the fertile soil of friendship. 'A ship's strength is in its sails, and a man's strength is in his heart,' said Li.

"39915","China","Chinese Surgeons to Perform 200 Free Cataracts Operations [#39914]","2015","false","STAFF_NOTES Linked to umbrella #39914 ARTICLE KINGSTON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese medical aid mission for eye disorders began work Monday in the Caribbean state of Jamaica. As a foreign aid project of the Chinese government, five doctors and three nurses from China are expected to perform some 200 cataract surgeries free of charge in 10 days at the Kingston state hospital. The Chinese aid also includes the donation of medical equipment and supplies worth 400,000 U.S. dollars to the hospital. At a welcoming ceremony, Horace Dalley, Jamaica's minister of public service, highlighted the assistance as the latest example of friendship between Jamaica and China, which have been 'long-standing partners in several areas over years.' Albert Lue, an ophthalmologist at the Kingston state hospital, told Xinhua that the aid from China is badly needed by his department. 'Many of the cataract patients in Jamaica cannot receive proper treatment due to the operation cost, and a lack of medical resources denies hospitalization to many complicated cases,' he said. According to Chinese Ambassador Dong Xiaojun, the 'Bright Journey' medical aid project of the Chinese government has since 2003 benefited up to 300 million eye patients in more than 70 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean, and the Oceania. The aid project was extended to cover Caribbean countries in 2013 following talks between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Caribbean leaders in Trinidad and Tobago. By the end of 2014, China has sent 65 medical professionals out of a total of 100 planned, to the Bahamas, Dominica, Guyana, and Trinidad and Tobago, either to work regularly at hospitals or to provide short-term medical services. The team now in Jamaica had helped 147 people recover sight in its previous stop in Antigua and Barbuda.","120","Health","","Implementation","2","Free-standing technical assistance","Jamaica","http://jm.china-embassy.org/eng/xw/t1267190.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://jm.china-embassy.org/eng/xw/t1267189.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient)","2","","","","","","","Raw","0","Unset","","Development","1","Inactive","2","","","","","","","","","","","","1","Jamaica","51","354","Jamaica","JAM","JM","388","343","false","false","false","false","","","","","","2015-11-02 13:34:25 -0500","Kingston Public Hospital","",0

"39154","China","China allocate US$ 31.5mn for the rebuilding of a stadium (duplicate of #39889)","2015","false","n recent years, China and Russia have been dancing with increasing vigor to the rhythms of Latin American trade and diplomacy. The two Eastern giants want business allies, resources and friends who share their desire to close the curtain on the era of United States dominance. As they tango across Latin America, they are finding all three in abundance. The U.S., apparently indifferent to the Chinese and Russian advance into its backyard, is sitting out more and more Latin American dances. But there is another global power whose salsa shoes won’t be coming off any time soon; this rising power bloc will check the advance of Beijing and Moscow into Latin America. China’s Cha Cha As the U.S. has retreated from Latin America, China has been the main player to cha cha its way into the void. From 2000 to 2009, trade between China and Latin America increased by a staggering 1,200 percent. If current trends persist, China will surpass the European Union next year to become Latin America’s second-largest trade partner. Within 10 years, trade between the two sides is expected to reach $500 billion per year. China’s dance into Latin America also includes an increasing amount of investment. Last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged to invest $250 billion into the region. “With relatively little fanfare,” said Latin America expert Juan de Onis, “China has taken over the inside lane of economic development in Latin America with an ambitious 10-year regional investment plan on the scale of the Marshall Plan.” From Cuba to Chile, the Chinese dragon is swaying its hips and sashaying to Latin America’s spicy, conga-driven polyrhythms. Offering a mojito here and sharing a fine cigar there, China is winning friends on the great Latin American dance floor. I saw some of this investment firsthand during a visit to St. George’s, Grenada, last October. A local tour guide named Duffy pointed out a massive sports stadium being rebuilt with $31.5 million allocated by the Chinese government. “We don’t really know why China wants to fix it for us,” Duffy told our group. “We think China wants Grenada to be eager to help them if they are ever in need.” China has also apparently broken ground on a canal through Nicaragua. The $50-billion venture is billed as the world’s largest engineering project, and is of immense geopolitical significance. It will see a 173-mile-long route cut through the Central American nation to connect the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Officials say it will open for business in 2019. The Nicaraguan Canal’s width and depth will dwarf that of the Panama Canal, several hundred miles south, allowing Nicaragua to accommodate modern freighters that are too large to pass through Panama. The overshadowing of the U.S.-built Panama Canal will significantly challenge American hegemony in Latin America. Critics of the project say it will also give China a de facto military base very near to the United States. (In October, I flew over a portion of the planned Nicaraguan canal route, and you can see one of my photos here). From Cuba to Chile, the Chinese dragon is swaying its hips and quickstepping to Latin America’s spicy, conga-driven polyrhythms. Offering a mint mojito here and sharing a fine cigar there, China is winning many friends on the great Latin American dance floor. Russia’s Rumba In the past decade, Russia has worked to reestablish the footing in Latin America that the Soviet Union held during the Cold War era. Its efforts have intensified in recent months after the U.S. and Europe slapped sanctions on Russia as punishment for its role in the Ukraine crisis. These sanctions prompted Moscow to steepen its tilt toward Latin American markets. In July, Russian President Vladimir Putin made a six-day tour of Latin America, visiting Cuba, Argentina, Brazil and Nicaragua, and meeting with 11 regional leaders. In Cuba, Putin signed several major oil and security contracts and forgave 90 percent (about $32 billion) of Cuban debts that stood unpaid since Soviet times. For a relatively poor nation such as Cuba to have so much debt forgiven is no small event. Putin said the remaining 10 percent would be reinvested into Cuba’s infrastructure. After the visit, reports emerged that Cuba had even agreed to reopen Soviet-era bases to Russia. Argentina is one of few nations who supported Russia’s annexation of Crimea. During Putin’s trip there, he rewarded that support by signing security and trade agreements and a landmark deal to build nuclear power plants in Argentina. Russia also offered to supply Argentina with a dozen fighter jets, which could inflame the Falkland Islands dispute. Putin signed similar deals with Brazil, along with agreements on aviation, weapons and technical cooperation. Putin’s visit to Nicaragua marked the first time a Russian president has traveled to the nation. He spoke with Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega about working together on issues ranging from security to agriculture. Ortega called Putin’s visit “historic” and a “ray of light.” In all four nations, Putin took steps to build stations for Glonass, Russia’s answer to the U.S.’s GPS. At the end of the tour, Putin said Russia needs to “reestablish a presence in this extremely interesting, very promising region of the world.” As the Russian bear promenades, swivels and dips across the vast Latin American dance floor, it is establishing a position for itself of unprecedented strategic value. Analysts viewed Putin’s tour itself as “extremely interesting,” especially given the timing of his rumba across the continent. “The fact that Vladimir Putin managed to set aside an entire week for a trip to the region is very revealing,” said Vladimir Davydov, director of the Institute of Latin America at the Russian Academy of Sciences, in an interview with Russia Beyond the Headlines. “It would seem to be an unaffordable luxury when there is an acute crisis on Russia’s borders. However, this tour is as relevant as ever. At a time when the West is trying to lure Russia into a ‘Ukrainian snare,’ it showed that Russia is entirely capable of regaining old allies and of making new ones.” In recent months, Russian bombers have patrolled the Caribbean, landing in Venezuela and Nicaragua. Russia has held joint military drills with Venezuela, and Russian ships have entered Cuban and Venezuelan ports. Meanwhile, Russian gas giant Gazprom is investing heavily in Argentina and Bolivia, and Russia’s state-run Rosneft firm is increasingly dynamic in Venezuela. As the Russian bear promenades, swivels and dips across the vast Latin American dance floor, it is establishing a position for itself of unprecedented strategic value. “It can … be argued that Russia is more influential in Latin America now than it ever was during the Cold War,” Moscow-based analyst Andrew Korybko wrote in the Aug. 22, 2014, Oriental Review. The Bear and Dragon Samba in Lockstep China and Russia do not feel threatened by one another’s drive into Latin America. Instead, the two are dancing hand-in-hand through key steps of their advance. To support the China-funded Nicaraguan Canal project, Russia has promised military backing to ensure safety during construction. Starting this year, Nicaragua will host a Russian base, and Moscow’s fleets will patrol the country’s Pacific and Caribbean coasts, making sure no one interferes with China’s mammoth project. In July, Putin and Xi crossed paths in Brazil to unveil a massive, new-world “development bank” to challenge U.S.-dominated financial institutions. Russia and China will operate the bank with the help of Brazil, as well as India and South Africa. This all adds up to a deeply significant trend. “Russian and Chinese involvement in the [Latin American] region is growing at a spectacular pace and in a multifaceted way, thus opening the possibility for a dramatic geopolitical transformation right on the doorsteps of the U.S.,” Korybko wrote. “Altogether, Latin America is the most suitable rear base for advancing the Multipolar World in the backyard of the fading unipolar giant,” he said. “Russia and China have absolutely no competing interests whatsoever in this theater, thus unquestionably showing the grand strategic aims of the RCSP [Russia China Strategic Partnership] in general.” Korybko explained that Latin America is eager to foxtrot with Russia and China because many nations of the region harbor “intense dislike” of the U.S. and know that Moscow and Beijing share the sentiment. For Russia and China, this intense dislike means Latin American nations can “be flexibly managed from afar to partake in even more detrimental actions against its former hegemon,” Korybko said. Will Europe Sit This One Out? The United States is indifferent to the Russo-Chinese advance into its backyard. But what about Europe? Will the Europeans allow their sister continent to become ever more aligned with Moscow and Beijing? Will Europe allow the tangoing bear and dragon to steal the show? For more than five centuries, Europe and Latin America have been bound together as sister continents by both religion and language. These cultural commonalities have long given European powers preferential economic treatment among most South and Central American nations. At present, the European Union remains Latin America’s second-largest trade partner (after the United States). Yet Europe’s influence in Latin America has slipped slightly as the ambitions of Beijing and Moscow have swelled. Chinese Marxist revolutionary Mao Tse Tung vowed to his people decades ago, “All that the West has, China will have.” China’s rapacious drive into Latin America is evidence that Mao’s words still resonate in the Chinese mindset. Be assured that Europe will not stand by passively and allow China and Russia elbow it off the dance floor. But be assured that Europe will not stand by passively and allow Beijing and Moscow to elbow it off the dance floor. Around the time Putin visited Cuba, Pope Francis sent letters to the leaders of Cuba and the United States. These letters played a key role in thawing U.S.-Cuban relations, which was announced in December. The pope’s role in that deal gives the Catholic Church—whose stronghold is Europe—renewed influence over Cuba. Will that influence be to the exclusion of Russia? For a time, Cuba’s Communist regime may be in a position to play both sides against each other. But even still, the pope’s maneuver significantly reduced Putin’s sway over the island nation. Then in January, the pope appointed five new Latin American cardinals, saying the move would “manifest the indissoluble links between the church of Rome” and the nations the men came from. Also in January, Germany took a major step toward strengthening cooperation with Mexico. At present, the lack of cohesion among European nations hinders Europe’s efforts to reign supreme in Latin America. But the deepening inroads that China and Russia are making will actually serve as a catalyst for the EU to unite. As China and Russia continue mamboing through the region, European nations will increasingly work together, under German leadership and under Vatican guidance, to bolster Europe’s own position on the great Latin American dance floor.
